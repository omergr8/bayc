        HighSteaks NFT currently remains as a collection of fun and witty art
        pieces. We are however exploring the options of creating a comic book
        series that dives deeper into the storylines of the steaks and all the
        risky adventures they encounter as a group. Another idea is to create a
        fighting game called "Beat the Meat". Both options will only be explore
        if the project sells 100% of the NFTs
