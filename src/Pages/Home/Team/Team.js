        <p>
          <span>Round</span> - The fattest of all the High Steaks. He eats more
          than his fair share of the group's edibles. All of the other High
          Steaks complain about his monstrous case of the muchies. He is
          responsible for the group's weekly grocery shopping.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Chuck</span> - The laziest of all the High Steaks. The other
          steaks see little value in Chuck since he stays at home and does
          nothing for a living. He does provide the best conversation when
          problems arise and tends to be a sage when shit hits the fan.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Filet Mignon</span> - A foreign exchange student who's addicted

          key to the success of famous rapper and housemate TBone.
        </p>

        <p>
