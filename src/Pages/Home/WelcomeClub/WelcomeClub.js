        When you buy a Bored Ape, youâ€™re not simply buying an avatar or a
        provably-rare piece of art. You are gaining membership access to a club
        whose benefits and offerings will increase over time. Your Bored Ape can
        serve as your digital identity, and open digital doors for you.
